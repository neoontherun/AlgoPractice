Each Angular application has exactly one root scope, but may have several child scopes.

When Angular evaluates a bound variable like say {{firstName}}, it first looks at the scope associated with the given element for the firstName
property. If no such property is found, it searches the parent scope and so on until the root scope is reached. In JavaScript this behaviour is known
as prototypical inheritance, and child scopes prototypically inherit from their parents. The reverse is not true. I.e. the parent can’t see it’s children’s
bound properties.
