Round 1 : 
	Design a travel search system. Input is the source & destination & a date. 
	If a bus goes from A->B->C->D->E, it should get listed in all the searches if user searches for AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE.
	Need to design meta data tables, access tables (from where the search is done) What would be the key to search - came up with - (SRC-DEST-DATEOFTRAVEL) with multiple entries for the same bus even if kind of duplicates to ease the search.
	For ex: AB-DT1, AC-DT1 & so on.	
	We continued to discuss on why we need to start using NodeJS & GoLang. Don’t just love your language but also open to new languages. Be ready to learn new things.
	He offered a new perspective of thinking the use case first & then decide on DS. Not decide DS/Tech & then think how to solve the problem. (Analogy is first decide how to solve search by identifying that a simplified key for fast access is required & then decide on the Map DS).
	he mentioned it took a week to learn goLang & should be easy for folks coding on c++ or .NET core tech which is more functional in nature but it also supports OO.
	Talked about golang use of channels in http (tcp) modules.

Round 2:
	OS / Network Fundamentals.
	1. Does a while (1) loop without any code occupy processor completely? Does the CPU monitor show 100%? (Yes fro Top command - I answered No). _ related to pre-emptive scheduling. 
	2. Follow up question, how does other process doesn’t get affected - there is a CPU time slice — follow up again - how will the CPU know? - it is thru interrupts. (He explained stack of IRQ’s)
	3. What is virtual memory?
	4. What is difference between semaphore / mutex?
	5. What is difference between TCP / UDP?
	6. How does DNS work? Not just concept - but underlying h/w workings.
	7. What is the difference between switch, router & hub? - I couldn’t answer.
	8. What is Base64 encoding & why is it required?
	9. What do you like about javascript & do not like about it?
	10. Have you worked on cloud based technologies?
	11. Different parts / components of OS?
	12. What is CAP theorem. Explain.
